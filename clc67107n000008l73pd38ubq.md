# #Day07 - Control Flow - Conditional Statements

Control flow is a fundamental part of programming, and you will use it extensively throughout your coding journey. Whether you're writing simple scripts or complex applications, control flow statements like if-else and switch are essential for controlling the flow of execution in your code.

Control flow refers to the order in which code is executed in a program. In JavaScript, there are several control flow statements that allow you to specify the conditions under which certain code blocks should be executed. In this article, we'll take a closer look at two of the most commonly used control flow statements in JavaScript: if-else statements and switch statements.

# What are if-else statements?

In JavaScript, if-else statements allow you to specify a condition, and if that condition is true, a block of code will be executed. If the condition is false, you can use an `else` clause to specify a different block of code to be executed. Here's the basic syntax for an if-else statement in JavaScript:

```js
if (condition) {
  // code to be executed if condition is true
} else {
  // code to be executed if condition is false
}
```

You can also use multiple `else if` clauses to test for multiple conditions:

```js
if (condition1) {
  // code to be executed if condition1 is true
} else if (condition2) {
  // code to be executed if condition1 is false and condition2 is true
} else {
  // code to be executed if condition1 and condition2 are false
}
```

## Examples of if-else statements

Let's look at some examples of how you might use if-else statements in your JavaScript code.

### Checking the weather

Imagine you want to write a function that suggests an activity based on the current weather. Here's how you might use an if-else statement to do this:

```js
let weather = "sunny";

if (weather === "sunny") {
  console.log("It's a beautiful day! Why not go for a hike or a bike ride?");
} else if (weather === "cloudy") {
  console.log("It's a bit overcast today. Maybe it's a good day for a museum or a bookstore?");
} else {
  console.log("It's raining or snowing. How about staying in and watching a movie?");
}
```

In this example, the `weather` variable is set to "sunny", and the if-else statement checks if the `weather` variable is equal to "sunny". If it is, the code inside the first block is executed. If it is not, the if-else statement checks if the `weather` variable is equal to "cloudy". If it is, the code inside the second block is executed. If it is not, the code inside the `else` block is executed.

## Nested if-else

You can also use if-else statements inside other if-else statements to create nested if-else statements. Nested if-else statements allow you to specify multiple levels of conditions, with each level being tested only if the preceding level is true. Here is an example of a nested if-else statement:

```js
if (condition1) {
  // code to be executed if condition1 is true
	  if (condition2) {
    // code to be executed if condition2 is true
	  } else {
    // code to be executed if condition2 is false
	  }
} else {
  // code to be executed if condition1 is false
}
```

In this example, the inner if-else statement is only executed if `condition1` is true. If `condition1` is false, the code inside the inner if-else statement is skipped and the code inside the outer `else` block is executed.

Nested if-else statements can be useful when you want to test for multiple conditions and execute different code blocks based on the combination of those conditions. However, it's important to be careful when using nested if-else statements, as they can make your code more complex and harder to read.

## Combining Multiple Conditions with Comparison and Logical Operators

If-else statements are a powerful tool for controlling the flow of execution in your code, and they allow you to specify different actions based on different conditions. In addition to simple comparisons like `===` and `!==`, if-else statements also allow you to use comparison operators like `>`, `<`, `>=`, and `<=` to test for ranges of values, and logical operators like `&&` and `||` to combine multiple conditions.

Here's an example of using comparison and logical operators in an if-else statement:

```js
let age = 25;

// check if age is greater than or equal to 18 and less than 65
if (age >= 18 && age < 65) {
  console.log("You are an adult.");
} 
// check if age is greater than or equal to 65
else if (age >= 65) {
  console.log("You are a senior citizen.");
} 
// if age is not greater than or equal to 18 or 65
else {
  console.log("You are a minor.");
}
```

In this example, the `age` variable is set to 25 and the if-else statement tests if the `age` is greater than or equal to 18 and less than 65 using the `&&` operator. If it is, the code inside the first block is executed. If it is not, the if-else statement tests if the `age` is greater than or equal to 65. If it is, the code inside the second block is executed. If it is not, the code inside the `else` block is executed.

# Switch statements

In addition to if-else statements, JavaScript also provides a control flow statement called a `switch` statement. A `switch` statement allows you to specify a number of different cases, and the code will execute the case that matches the specified value. Here's the basic syntax for a `switch` statement in JavaScript:

```js
switch (expression) {
  case value1:
    // code to be executed if expression equals value1
    break;
  case value2:
    // code to be executed if expression equals value2
    break;
  default:
    // code to be executed if expression doesn't match any of the cases
}
```

The `expression` in a `switch` statement is typically a variable or an expression that evaluates to a value. The `case` clauses specify the different values that the `expression` can be, and the code inside each `case` clause is executed if the `expression` equals that value. The `default` clause specifies code to be executed if the `expression` doesn't match any of the `case` values.

It's important to note that the `break` the statement is used to exit each `case` clause and prevent the code in the following cases from being executed. If you omit the `break` the statement, the code in all subsequent `case` clauses will be executed, regardless of whether the `expression` matches those values.

# Best practices for using if-else statements

Here are a few best practices to keep in mind when using if-else statements in your JavaScript code:

* Use clear, concise conditionals: Make sure your conditions are easy to understand and free of unnecessary complexity.
    
* Avoid nesting if-else statements too deeply: While it's sometimes necessary to nest if-else statements, try to keep your code as flat as possible to avoid creating hard-to-read code.
    
* Test all possible cases: Make sure you've covered all possible cases in your if-else statements, including the `else` clause for cases where none of the conditions are true.
    
* Use `else if` clauses sparingly: While `else if` clauses can be useful for testing multiple conditions, too many of them can make your code harder to read and maintain.
    

By following these best practices, you can write clear, readable code that makes use of if-else statements to control the flow of execution in your programs.

# Conclusion

In summary, if-else statements are a crucial tool for controlling the flow of execution in JavaScript. Whether you're checking the weather, validating user input, or making any other type of a decision, if-else statements can help you write code that executes different actions based on different conditions. With a little practice and attention to best practices, you can master the use of if-else statements and take your JavaScript skills to the next level.
