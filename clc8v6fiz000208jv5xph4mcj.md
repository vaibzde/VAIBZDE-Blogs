# #Day 09 - Mastering Functions in JavaScript: A Comprehensive Guide

# Introduction

Functions are a fundamental concept in any programming language, and JavaScript is no exception. In this comprehensive guide, we'll delve into everything you need to know about functions in JavaScript.

But before we dive into the details, let's start by answering this question:

What are functions in JavaScript?

In the most basic sense, a function is a block of code that performs a specific task. You can think of a function as a "machine" that takes in some input (called arguments or parameters), performs an operation on that input, and then produces some output (called a return value).

But the power of functions goes far beyond this simple definition. In JavaScript, functions are a key tool for organizing and reusing code, making it easier to write and maintain complex programs. Functions also allow you to break down your code into smaller, more manageable pieces, making it easier to debug and understand.

In this post, we'll cover everything you need to know about functions in JavaScript, including how to write and declare them, how to use parameters and return values, and the advantages of using functions. We'll also look at function hoisting and function expressions, these concepts are important to understand as you progress in your JavaScript journey.

Let's dive in!

# Functions in JavaScript

A function is a piece of code that performs a specific task and which can be reused.

It is defined using the `function` keyword.

Suppose you need to write a program to find if the sum of two numbers is greater than 10. You could write the following functions for it:

* A function that adds two numbers.
    
* A function which checks if the number is greater than 10.
    
    Functions make our code more readable and reusable
    

> **In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens.**

Hey, but what is a first-class citizen in a programming language?

### first-class citizens in programming languages

In programming languages, first-class citizens (also known as first-class objects) are values that can be treated like any other value. This means that they can be stored in variables, passed as arguments to functions, and returned from functions.

In JavaScript, all values are considered to be first-class citizens. This includes primitive values such as numbers, strings, and booleans, as well as objects and functions.

# How to write a function?

The `function` keyword is used to declare a function in JavaScript. To write a function using the `function` keyword, you follow this syntax:

```js
function functionName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) {
  // function body
  // code to be executed goes here
  return value;
}
```

The syntax that we used above for creating a function is called a **function declaration**

To understand the above code, and to have an understanding of writing a function. One should know the structure of the function.. So let's understand.

## Structure of function in Javascript

A function in JavaScript has a defined structure that consists of the following elements:

```js
function functionName(parameter1, parameter2, ...) {
  // function body
  // code to be executed goes here
  return value;
}
```

* `function` is a reserved keyword that indicates that the following code is a function.
    
* `functionName` is the name of the function. It can be any valid JavaScript identifier.
    
* `parameter1`, `parameter2`, etc. are optional **parameters** that the function can accept. They are placeholders for the values that will be passed to the function when it is called.
    
* The code to be executed by the function goes inside the `{}` curly braces. This is known as the **function body**.
    
* The `return` statement is used to specify the value that the function should output when it is finished executing.
    
    * The value following the `return` keyword is known as the **return value**.
        
    * If a function does not have a `return` statement, it is considered to have a return value of `undefined`.
        

### Invoking a Function

To invoke (or call) a function in JavaScript, you use its name followed by a list of arguments enclosed in `**()**` parentheses. The arguments are the values that you want to pass to the function's parameters.

For example, consider the following function that adds two numbers and returns their sum:

```js
 //A function with name add is declared
function add(a, b) {// a and b are parameters
  return a + b; //the add function is returning the addition of values that it got through a and b
}

/// To call this function and get the result, you would do the following:

let result = add(2, 3); //here add() function is called
//here 2 and 3 are arguments, which are received by parameters a and b repectively

// result is 5
```

You can also pass variables as arguments to a function.

You can invoke a function as many times as you like, with different arguments each time. This allows you to reuse the same code to perform different tasks.

It is important to understand parameters and arguments, which we have seen in above example

* Function parameters are the variable names listed in the function definition.
    
* Function arguments are the real values passed to (and received by) the function
    

# Different ways to declare a `function`

As said, the syntax that we used earlier for creating a function is called a **function declaration**.  
There is another syntax for creating a function that is called a **function expression**.

## Function expression:

* Assigns a function to a variable using the `function` keyword.
    
* The function's code goes inside curly braces.
    
* Must be defined before it is called.
    

```js
let functionName = function(argument1, argument2, ...) {
  // function body
  // code to be executed goes here
  return value;
};
```

In JavaScript, there is also another way of declaring a function. An **Arrow function**, which is often used in place of a regular function expression because it is shorter and easier to read.

## Arrow function expression:

* Uses the `=>` syntax to define a function.
    
* The function's code goes inside curly braces.
    
* Must be defined before it is called.
    

```js
let functionName = (argument1, argument2, ...) => {
  // function body
  // code to be executed goes here
  return value;
};
```

# Function Hoisting

In JavaScript, function declarations are subject to hoisting, which means that they can be used before they are defined. This is because the JavaScript engine moves function declarations to the top of the current scope at runtime.

Consider the following example:

```js
console.log(add(2, 3)); // 5

function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
```

Here, the `add` function is called before it is defined, but the code still works because of function hoisting. At runtime, the JavaScript engine moves the function declaration to the top of the current scope, making it available for use throughout the scope.

> IMPORTANT NOTE: **function hoisting only applies to function declarations, and not to function expressions**

It is generally best to define your functions before you use them to avoid any potential issues.

# Advantages of Using Functions

Functions are a key tool for organizing and reusing code in JavaScript. They offer several advantages, including:

1. **Code reuse:** Functions allow you to reuse the same code multiple times, saving you time and effort.
    
2. **Code organization:** Functions help you to break down your code into smaller, more manageable pieces, making it easier to read and understand.
    
3. **Modularity:** Functions allow you to write code that is more modular, meaning that you can easily reuse individual pieces of code in different parts of your program.
    
4. **Debugging:** Functions allow you to isolate specific pieces of code for debugging, making it easier to identify and fix issues.
    
5. **Performance:** Functions can be optimized by the JavaScript engine, leading to better performance.
    
6. **Readability:** Functions make your code more readable by giving it a clear structure and purpose.
    
7. **Maintainability:** Functions allow you to update and maintain your code more easily, as you only need to make changes in one place.
    

Overall, using functions can help you to write better, more efficient, and more maintainable code in JavaScript.
