Based on the syllabus, notes, and the class test questions provided, here are five crucial questions that cover the fundamental topics of the unit and align with the 8-mark format:

### Q 1.1 Derive the expression for the power developed due to wind. Calculate the total power density in the wind stream, assuming a wind velocity of 10 m/s, a turbine diameter of 120 m, and an operating speed of 40 rpm at maximum efficiency. Also, determine the maximum obtainable power density assuming an efficiency of 40%, the total power produced in kW, and the torque and axial thrust. (8 marks)

Ans - The expression for the power developed due to wind can be derived using the formula:

P = 0.5 *ρ* A \* V^3

where: P represents the power developed due to wind, ρ is the air density, A is the swept area of the wind turbine blades, and V is the wind velocity.

This formula shows that the power generated by a wind turbine is proportional to the air density, the swept area of the turbine blades, and the cube of the wind velocity.

Point 2: To calculate the total power density in the wind stream, we need to determine the swept area of the wind turbine blades. Given a turbine diameter of 120 m, the radius can be calculated as 60 m. The swept area (A) can be calculated using the formula A = π \* r^2, where r is the radius of the turbine.

Point 3: With a wind velocity of 10 m/s and the swept area determined in Point 2, we can substitute the values into the power formula (P = 0.5 *ρ* A \* V^3) to calculate the power density in the wind stream.

Point 4: To determine the maximum obtainable power density assuming an efficiency of 40%, we multiply the power density (calculated in Point 3) by the efficiency percentage.

Point 5: To calculate the total power produced in kW, we multiply the power density (calculated in Point 3) by the swept area (A) and the air density (ρ).

Point 6: Calculating the torque and axial thrust requires additional information such as the specific design and characteristics of the wind turbine. Without these details, a specific calculation cannot be provided.

Point 7: It is important to note that the calculations performed assume ideal conditions and may vary in real-world scenarios due to factors such as turbulence, air density variations, and mechanical losses.

Point 8: Understanding the derivation and calculations involved in the power developed due to wind is crucial for analyzing wind turbine performance, optimizing power output, and designing efficient wind energy systems.

Explain why the rotor's collection efficiency is typically lower than the Betz limit and the overall energy conversion efficiency of a complete wind energy system. (8 marks)

Response:

Betz Limit and Its Relation to Wind Turbine Efficiency:

1\. Betz Limit:

\- The Betz limit, also known as the Betz coefficient or Betz's law, is a theoretical limit that defines the maximum amount of kinetic energy that a wind turbine's rotor can extract from the wind.

\- It was formulated by German physicist Albert Betz in 1919 and states that no wind turbine can capture more than 59.3% (or approximately 16/27) of the kinetic energy present in the wind.

2\. Efficiency of a Wind Turbine:

\- The efficiency of a wind turbine refers to its ability to convert the kinetic energy of the wind into mechanical or electrical energy.

\- It is often expressed as a percentage and calculated by dividing the actual energy output by the energy available in the wind.

3\. Relation to Betz Limit:

\- The efficiency of a wind turbine is limited by the Betz limit, which establishes the theoretical maximum amount of energy that can be collected by the rotor.

\- According to the Betz limit, a wind turbine can capture a maximum of 59.3% of the kinetic energy in the wind passing through its rotor area.

\- Any attempt to capture more energy beyond this limit would result in increased drag and turbulence, leading to reduced efficiency and increased losses.

4\. Reasons for Lower Efficiency:

\- The rotor's collection efficiency, which is the ratio of the actual energy captured by the rotor to the available kinetic energy in the wind, is typically lower than the Betz limit due to several factors.

\- Aerodynamic losses: As the wind passes through the rotor, it encounters aerodynamic drag, turbulence, and friction, resulting in energy losses.

\- Wake effects: When the wind passes through the rotor, it creates a turbulent wake downstream, reducing the energy available to subsequent rotor blades.

\- Mechanical losses: The conversion of mechanical energy from the rotor to electrical energy involves losses in the generator and other mechanical components.

\- Electrical losses: Transmission and conversion of electrical energy within the wind energy system also contribute to overall efficiency losses.

5\. Overall Energy Conversion Efficiency:

\- The overall energy conversion efficiency of a complete wind energy system, including the wind turbine, generator, controller, and electrical grid connection, is influenced by factors beyond the rotor's collection efficiency.

\- It takes into account additional losses in power transmission, electrical conversion, and system operation.

\- While the rotor's collection efficiency is limited by the Betz limit, the overall energy conversion efficiency of a wind energy system is influenced by various factors and is typically lower than the theoretical maximum.

### Q 1.5. Explain the operating characteristics of wind turbines, including cut-in speed, rated speed, and cut-out speed.

1\. Cut-in Speed:

\- The cut-in speed is the minimum wind speed at which a wind turbine starts generating usable power.

\- It is the speed at which the turbine blades begin to rotate and the generator begins to produce electricity.

\- Typically, the cut-in speed is around 3-4 meters per second (m/s) for most modern wind turbines.

2\. Rated Speed:

\- The rated speed of a wind turbine is the wind speed at which the turbine is designed to produce its maximum rated power output.

\- It represents the optimal operating speed for the turbine and is typically around 10-15 m/s.

\- At the rated speed, the turbine operates at its highest efficiency, converting a maximum amount of wind energy into electrical power.

3\. Cut-out Speed:

\- The cut-out speed is the maximum wind speed at which a wind turbine shuts down to prevent damage from high wind conditions.

\- It is the speed at which the turbine stops operating to protect its components, such as the blades and the generator.

\- The cut-out speed is typically around 25-30 m/s, but it can vary depending on the specific design and safety features of the turbine.

Significance of Operating Speeds:

4\. Operational Range:

\- The combination of cut-in, rated, and cut-out speeds defines the operational range of a wind turbine.

\- The operational range represents the range of wind speeds within which the turbine can effectively generate power and operate safely.

\- Wind speeds below the cut-in speed are not sufficient to generate power, while wind speeds above the cut-out speed can be detrimental to the turbine's integrity.

5\. Safe and Efficient Functioning:

\- The cut-in speed ensures that the turbine starts operating at a wind speed that provides a minimum level of energy for power generation.

\- The rated speed allows the turbine to operate at its peak efficiency, maximizing the conversion of wind energy into electrical power.

\- The cut-out speed helps protect the turbine from extreme wind conditions that could cause structural damage or operational issues.

6\. Variable Wind Conditions:

\- Wind conditions can vary significantly, and the operating characteristics of a wind turbine help it adapt to these changes.

\- By having specific cut-in, rated, and cut-out speeds, the turbine can respond to different wind speeds and adjust its power output accordingly.

\- This ensures that the turbine operates safely and efficiently across a wide range of wind conditions.

Response:

![](https://energyeducation.ca/wiki/images/thumb/1/19/Windpowercurve.png/400px-Windpowercurve.png align="center")

1\. Power versus Wind Speed Characteristics of a Wind Turbine:

\- Wind turbines have a specific power curve that shows the relationship between the wind speed and the power output of the turbine.

\- The power curve typically exhibits an S-shaped curve, starting with low power output at low wind speeds, reaching a maximum power output at an optimal wind speed, and then leveling off or decreasing at higher wind speeds.

\- At low wind speeds, the turbine requires a minimum threshold called the cut-in wind speed to start generating power. Below this threshold, the turbine may not produce any significant power.

\- As the wind speed increases beyond the cut-in wind speed, the power output of the turbine increases rapidly, following an approximately cubic relationship with the wind speed.

\- At the rated wind speed, which is the wind speed at which the turbine is designed to achieve its maximum power output, the turbine operates at its optimal performance point.

\- Beyond the rated wind speed, the power output tends to level off or even decrease due to limitations in the turbine design, such as aerodynamic inefficiencies and mechanical stress considerations.

\- Finally, there is a cut-out wind speed, which represents the wind speed at which the turbine shuts down to prevent damage during extremely high wind conditions.

2\. Impact on Performance and Efficiency:

\- The power versus wind speed characteristics directly affect the performance and efficiency of wind turbines.

\- Wind turbines are designed to operate optimally at a specific wind speed range, typically around the rated wind speed. Operating within this range maximizes the power output and efficiency of the turbine.

\- Below the cut-in wind speed, the turbine may not generate enough power to be economically viable or may not start at all. Therefore, a higher cut-in wind speed may limit the energy capture potential of the turbine.

\- The shape of the power curve determines how the turbine responds to changes in wind speed. A steep and well-defined power curve allows the turbine to quickly adapt and produce higher power output with increasing wind speed.

\- Aerodynamic and mechanical design considerations influence the shape of the power curve. Efficient blade designs and control mechanisms aim to achieve a wider and smoother power curve, enabling the turbine to capture a broader range of wind speeds effectively.

\- The cut-out wind speed is crucial for the protection of the turbine. Shutting down at high wind speeds prevents excessive stress on the turbine components and ensures its long-term durability and safety.

3\. Overall Considerations:

\- Understanding the power versus wind speed characteristics is vital for wind turbine selection, placement, and optimization.

\- Turbines with higher-rated wind speeds are suitable for sites with consistently high wind speeds, while turbines with lower-rated wind speeds are more suitable for areas with lower wind speeds.

\- Matching the wind turbine's power curve with the wind resource at a specific location ensures maximum energy capture and efficient operation.

\- Additionally, optimizing the turbine's control system to adapt to varying wind conditions can further enhance its performance and overall efficiency.
